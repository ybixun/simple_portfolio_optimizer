# Simple Portfolio Optimizer Project

This project provides a portfolio optimizer model that allows asset/portfolio managers to efficiently get an optimized allocation of stocks and bonds based on annualized returns and conditional variance-at-risk (VaR).

## Introduction

This project was actually done for the purpose of my school module where we are required to do up an individual project that involves using linear optimization to resolve a business problem. Being someone from a finance/accounting background, I thought of using linear optimization to improve the efficiency of coming up with allocation of assets and bonds to get an optimized portfolio for clients depending on their risk appetite and their expected returns.

## Features

- Linear-optimization model that can be utilized to get optimized allocation of assets.
- Data visualisation on aiding the asset/portfolio manager in other aspects of portfolio management.
- Automation in extracting the returns and details from all the .csv documents into a master list of consolidated stocks. 

## Technologies Used

Python 3.10.9
